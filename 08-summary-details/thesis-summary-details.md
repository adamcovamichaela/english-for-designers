The topic of this bachelor´s thesis is the conception and visual identity of grocery shopping & charity mobile application. Theoretical part of the thesis includes theory of existing apps and UX, the conception and the process of designing. The main aim of the work is to make shopping easier and quicker, but also to make charity more common. Practical part is an analysis of buyer's needs at first, then the designing based on user's needs found out from analysis, and making the functional prototype of the app. 

### Analysis
The thesis starts with a customer analysis, the aim was to find out how customers behave while shopping, what obstacles are they going through and what their opinion is about charity in general and about donating money to charities. The analysis came up with some really important facts. People visit supermarkets or hypermarkets more than the small groceries. It happends to them that they are looking for some products for a long time and they feel bothered by that. One of the interesting facts was also the one, that people would like to donate more money, if they have the opportunity of such an app.

### Result
The process of making the app was in respect to this analysis and customer's issues and needs. That's why the app has two main functions – to navigate and to donate – but also some more minor functions as saving the shopping lists.
