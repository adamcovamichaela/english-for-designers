## Stealing other's work?

##### The article I've read is so much full of interesting facts. I've never really copied some work. Yes, I make some moodboards for my work inspiration, but I always thought copying is just bad. Stealing others ideas. Only thing I learned to do recently is to make some colour palettes directly from pictures I like. As there was written – just eyedropping the colors and use them for my purpose. 

#### And another thing about copying. I think, that there is not almost anything, that does not exist. 

##### We all have our own mobile phone which we can take lots of pictures with. Even a lot of people from poor countries have it. We all can download editing apps easily. That is not a big deal. The photography work is not only for professionals anymore. The same situation comes with graphic design. There are free tools people can work with. They can play. Maybe some of them think they don't need any professional graphic designer to help, because it is easy to make their own work. With online app. And yes, it is easy. And this opportunity of being creative in an really easy way in connection with internet and social media cause, that there is already so many things made, created. Every day. A lot of it is the same all over again, but some are original, creative from talented people.  

#### The truth is: What two people do is never the same. 

###### And because there is not almost anything, that does not exist already, and because if two people do the same, it is not the same, then we can maybe have a good reason to not be scared of copying anymore. We can get inspired and maybe even try to do the same thing, but it won't be the same, because we will make it in our own style.
