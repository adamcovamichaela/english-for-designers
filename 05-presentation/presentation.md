#### My First Attempts

###### For the first time in my life I tried to take pictures when I was 10 or 11 years old. I borrowed a basic compact camera from my parents and I liked to take pictures of little bees and flowers in our garden, so you could find me sitting in flowerbeds among flowers and strawberries taking some pictures over and over again. 
###### I think that unfortunately I don’t have the first picture ever I’ve taken. But the first ones are one of my first attempts. That close-up photography type is called macro photography. However, you should have special equipment for that, but I had only the basic camera and macro pictures were something that I enjoyed much more than a landscape. I remember that I was so happy when I took the picture of the fly, I didn’t know I can make a picture like this with such a basic camera.

#### My First Mirror Camera, yay!
###### Then, few years later of sitting in my mom’s flowerbeds, I got my first SLR mirror camera after some unpleasant circumstances. So I started to learn how to use the camera, how to work with all the manual things as exposure time, aperture and iso. I started to use RAW file and learn how to take pictures of landscape and how to edit pictures properly. That was a loooooong journey. 
###### And I still took some macro pictures. This time, with much more quality. You can see the difference between the quality. 

#### Night Sky Photography
###### Then I started to learn night sky photography. When it comes to the night sky photography, it is really important to learn the process. The process of setting the camera, but also the editing part. You can see some my first attempt ever in the presentation and then the process of learning. Then I tried and played, I captured Milky Way for the very first time, I learned how to do Startrails – ss the globe is turning around, the stars are moving. So if you shoot for a long period of time, you will make these star trails. Also a northern star can be in the picture, it is the one in the center. I have some pictures, where there are 2 hours in one picture. 

###### One picture with the two hills is is captured during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which is in April/May. The strong line you can see there is Mars. Or another one is with perseids meteor shower in august.

#### When I saw Aurora Borealis
###### Then there is picture with from a night when we expected aurora borealis to occur in the north of Czech Republic. We were about to go home, but suddenly I have seen something. You can see a bit in the left corner of the picture... But. Go ahead to the next slide. There it is, aurora borealis in the Czech Republic. This is captured only 5 kilometers from my home. It was in March in 2015.

#### Traveling
###### Then I started to travel more so I could finally photograph a different way too. Something from Asia, this is Singapur. And I looove to capture animals all over the world. I just love animals so much, so thats why they are in lots of my pictures. So you can see some water bulls when we were riding down the road in Thai jungle. But also kids are cute, there is a young boy in front of his school running around while waiting for his parents.

###### I have many many pictures, but I choosed to show you some from my roadtrip in Ukraine. You can see the village life in nature, which is beautiful. Almost every family has a cow and other animals, they grow their own food, they buy only oil and flour. We were also invited to visit a local family, when I was capturing the picture or a cow and some woman came to me and she was like “ooooh thats my cow, do you want to come and taste some milk?”. We spent there a lot of time and it was super fine to talk to them about a lot of themes and differences between Ukraine and Czechia.

#### Phone Pictures
###### I also like to take pictures with my phone, I have it all the time with me so I can capture more raw moments than with my camera.

#### Post Processing
###### I thought I could show you some pieces with before and after because post process is so important in photography. I will show most pictures you saw and some you haven’t seen yet. With editing you can make nice parts even more visible and make nice emphasizes. 

#### Do what you love to do.
###### I would just like to say to you, that do what you love, no matter if you are good or not at it. if you love something, then it is the most beautiful thing to do.
