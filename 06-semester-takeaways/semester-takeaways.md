## Semester Takeaways

I got to know GitHub and learned how to use it.
I practiced writing and I finally came up to using Grammarly.
I liked the topics you came with.
I learned that there is nothing wrong with copying and that you can actually learn a lot from remaking things.
I learned what it means to have a teacher who is always supporting and come up with a lot of new ideas.

Thank you!
