## Writing Style

I hope it is right to talk about my writing style. I've read that article about copying or stealing and I was inspired of what I could write about. 

## Voice

1. Honest – I just wrote down what I think
2. Self-reflective – I was thinking what I feel about copying and what I felt for my entire life
3. Comprehending / Realizing – I found out that what two people do is not the same.
4. Personal – It is all about my experience and opinion, other's opinion can be different.
5. Easy / Light-hearted - It is not a big deal, just do what you love.

## Tone

I think my writing tone might be inspirational, because people can realise that it is so hard to make something completely new, that they dont have to feel bad about inspiring anymore.
